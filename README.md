# VRPong

VRPong is a virtual reality (VR) game made with Godot game engine. The game is designed to be played with a VR headset and controllers.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dokkae6949/VRPong.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the project in Godot by selecting the `project.godot` file in the root directory of the project.

## Branches

We recommend that you use the `pre` branch for development work. This branch contains the latest stable version of the game, and it is where you can make changes and test new features. Once you have tested your changes and you are ready to release a new version, you can merge your changes into the `main` branch.

Please note that the `main` branch is only supposed to be pushed to as a final step, after all testing and development work has been completed.

## Exporting

To export the game for use with a VR headset, you will need to configure the export settings in Godot. This may involve setting up your own export shortcut or creating a custom export template for your particular VR system.

We recommend that you consult the Godot documentation and community resources for more information on exporting VR games from Godot.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. Once you have made your changes, submit a pull request to the `pre` branch for review.
